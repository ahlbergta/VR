Tilt Brush

Tilt Brush by Google is a 3D VR painting software. It allows you to move around your artwork,
gives you access to multiple dynamic brushes, allows you to easily share your work, provides
you with easy-to-use tools, and allows you to import and export images and 3D models for
reference. It can be used for 3D modeling, art, design, teaching and entertainment. Tilt Brush
is available on Steam for the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift and requires controllers.
 
Some weaknesses of Tilt Brush are that collaboration is not yet possible through this software
and it does not allow for 3D sculpting or 3D texturing. The risk of nausea is always present
when using VR technology, however, there is not much camera movement involved with Tilt Brush.
Nausea may be induced by bright flashing colors.

Similar applications include: Unbound, Substance Painter and Facebook Quill. Unbound is in
early access so Tilt Brush will be more stable than it. Substance Painter costs $149.99 so
it is not a viable option for most consumers. Facebook Quill has fewer features and is more
difficult to use than Tilt Brush.
